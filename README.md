# NeuralTicTacToe

A simple solver for TicTacToe implemented as a very basic neural network in Rust.
The network is trained over all possible game state and actions obtained from a minmax solver.
After the training (that can be stopped by various configurable conditions), it's possible to play against the trained
network.
